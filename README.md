# HTML-Tester
##A code made to test HTML, CSS and JavaScript in real time.
>p.s.: May not work correctly in Internet Explorer.

The layout is simple:

A text box containing the css code, a text box containing the html code and a frame to view the results.

You have the option to disable/enable the auto update frame into the checkbox (AKA "Atualizar automaticamente");

You can open the result into a new page by clicking into the button "Abrir em nova guia";

And you can save the result by clicking into the button "Salvar como..."
>(The save button works with html5. If you don't have html5, try right click on the button and "Save as..." option)

## Update notes:
```
1. First version
  1. Created the first version.
2. First Updates
  1. Included into the code the option to auto update.
  2. The F5 key will now only update the frame, but still have problems when the focus of the page is into the frame.
```
