# HTML-Tester
##A code made to test HTML, CSS and JavaScript in real time.
>p.s.: May not work correctly in Internet Explorer.
```
The layout is simple:
A textbox to write the css code, a textbox containing the html code and a frame to view the results.
You have the option to disable/enable the auto update frame into the checkbox
(AKA "Atualizar automaticamente");
You can open the result into a new page by clicking into the button "Abrir em nova guia";
And you can save the result by clicking into the button "Salvar como..."
```
>(The save button works with html5. If you don't have html5, try right click on the button and "Save as..." option)

## Update notes:
```

```
